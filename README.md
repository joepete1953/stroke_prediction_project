# 🧠 Stroke Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning & MLOps System

This project implements a **complete, production-style Stroke Risk Prediction system** using real-world MLOps practices.  
It not only builds a strong ML model but also demonstrates:

- ✔️ Data engineering & preprocessing  
- ✔️ Structured ML experimentation  
- ✔️ PCA & Hyperparameter Tuning  
- ✔️ Experiment tracking with DagsHub / MLflow  
- ✔️ Database integration  
- ✔️ FastAPI backend  
- ✔️ Streamlit frontend  
- ✔️ Dockerized cloud deployment (DigitalOcean)

This project is designed to satisfy both **academic requirements** and **industry standards**.

## 🩺 Problem Statement
Stroke is a major global health risk. Early prediction can support medical decisions and prevention.

Given patient health & lifestyle data, the project **predicts whether a person is likely to have a stroke (binary classification)**.
